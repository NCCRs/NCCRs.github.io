These limitations present a major challenge to microbiome research by hindering the streamlined drawing of inferences across studies. Here, we propose guiding principles to make microbial data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).<br>We outline specific use cases for interaction and sequence data that span the diverse space of microbiome research, and discuss the untapped potential for new insights that can be fulfilled through broader integration of microbial interaction data. These include, among others, the design of intercompatible synthetic communities for environmental, industrial, or medical applications, and the inference of novel interactions from disparate studies. Lastly, we describe work in progress for the deployment of FAIR microbial data based on existing resources, reporting standards, and current momentum within the community.",

Not only do funders expect the sharing of data after the project’s completion, but also an increasing number of scientific journals make data sharing a condition for publication. While researchers tend to express positive attitudes towards data sharing, this is not without posing several legal, ethical and practical challenges. This holds particularly for researchers working with sensitive data, as they are subject to strict rules and principles. In the first part, this workshop will provide theoretical and practical insights for sharing sensitive data and meet Open Science requirements.<br>The second part of the workshop will deal with the topic of anonymisation of quantitative research data. It will present key concepts of anonymisation to help researchers to develop an appropriate anonymization strategy, and to provide the main techniques for anonymizing their data. Examples will be discussed along small exercises. The workshop takes a social sciences perspective but is relevant to anyone working with sensitive data. It will alternate between presentations and short exercises, which will allow to understand the challenges related to this topic in a practical way.",
